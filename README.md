# NETFLIX_SQL_PROJECT

üé¨ Netflix Content Analysis (SQL Project)
Dive Deep into Netflix Data with SQL! üöÄ
Welcome to my Netflix Content Analysis project! This repository showcases a comprehensive SQL-based exploration of Netflix's vast library of movies and TV shows. Using a custom-built database, I've dug into various aspects of the content, from popular genres and top directors to content trends over the years.

üåü Project Objectives:
The main goals of this project were to:

Understand Content Distribution: Analyze the ratio of Movies to TV Shows on the platform.


Identify Popular Trends: Discover the most common ratings, top countries for content production, and popular genres.


Explore Content Dynamics: Investigate content additions over time, identify long-form content, and analyze director and actor contributions.


Uncover Hidden Insights: Categorize content based on descriptive keywords to understand underlying themes.


Practice Advanced SQL: Utilize various SQL functions, including GROUP BY, ORDER BY, JOIN (if applicable in a more complex schema), COUNT, MAX, EXTRACT, TO_DATE, ILIKE, SPLIT_PART, UNNEST, and STRING_TO_ARRAY to extract meaningful information.

üìä Key Results & Insights:
Here's a glimpse of the interesting findings from my analysis:

 
 Content Type Dominance: I found that Movies significantly outnumber TV Shows on Netflix, highlighting a focus on film content.


Rating Landscape: Identified the most prevalent content ratings across both movies and TV shows, indicating the general audience demographic Netflix caters to.

Geographical Hotspots: Discovered the top 5 countries contributing the most content to Netflix, revealing key production hubs.


(e.g., "United States" typically leads, followed by "India" and "United Kingdom" in many datasets!)
